Image Processing Project in 8th semester with [Nirabhra](https://github.com/nirabhratapaswi), [Abhinandan](https://github.com/AbhiNabera), and [Jittam Bhattacharya](https://github.com/JittamBhattacharya) 

This repo contains code only for the Grid detection, and for the digit recognition part, which was done with the help of CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)

Please look at [this](https://github.com/nirabhratapaswi/sudoku_solver "Nirabhra's Django Frontend") repository by Nirabhra for the implementation with a Django server.
