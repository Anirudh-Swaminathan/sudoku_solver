# sudoku_solver
Image Processing Project in 8th semester with @nirabhratapaswi (Nirabhra), @AbhiNabera (Abhinandan), and @JittamBhattacharya (Jittam)

This repo contains code only for the Grid detection, and for the digit recognition part, which was done with the help of CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)

Please look at [this](https://github.com/nirabhratapaswi/sudoku_solver "Nirabhra's Django Frontend") repository by Nirabhra for the implementation with a Django server.
